Description: Nonlinear regression of biological data involves choosing a model to fit the data while providing initial estimtes of the model's parameters. Regression optimizes the model fit by iteratively improving these parameter estimates. This package simplifies nlme-based nonlinear regression in R by providing several functions with pre-specified model formulas and intuitive parameter values. These functions focus on common hyperbolic stimulus-response (dose-response, binding) and exponential (growth, decay) phenomena of biological systems. Each model has a companion function for simulating responses.
